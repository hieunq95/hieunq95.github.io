I am a Senior Wireless Engineer at Huawei Singapore Research Center. Before that, I spent some time at Deloitte Australia developing LLM agents for knowledge retrieval. I obtained my PhD from University of Technology Sydney, Australia, where I worked with Prof. [Hoang Dinh](https://sites.google.com/view/dinh-thai-hoang/) and Prof. [Diep Nguyen](https://sites.google.com/view/diep-n-nguyen/home?authuser=0). Prior to that, I worked as a Research Engineer in Prof. [Dusit Niyato](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/dniyato/)'s group at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

Experience
======
My work experience includes wireless communications topics:
- Wireless channel estimation and modelling
- Wireless sensor networks (sensing, signal processing, and data scheduling)

I am interested in using machine learning & deep learning algorithms to solve emerging problems in wireless communications.
