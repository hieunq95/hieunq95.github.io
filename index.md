## About Me

I am a third-year Ph.D. student at School of Electrical and Data Engineering, University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia, working with Dr. [Hoang Dinh](https://sites.google.com/view/dinh-thai-hoang/) and Dr. [Diep Nguyen](https://sites.google.com/view/diep-n-nguyen/). Before joining UTS, I was a research assistant at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, working with Prof. [Dusit Niyato](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/dniyato/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in 2018 from Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam, under supervison of Dr. Nguyen Huu Thanh. 

## Research Interests

During my time at NTU Singapore, I focused on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to address optimization and sequential decision-making challenges in communication systems, including blockchain networks, integrated sensing-communications, rate splitting multiple access, and edge computing. The similar concept of DRL has been used widely to train large language models.
 My PhD studies at UTS broadened my research interests to advanced topics like human sensing towards extended reality applications in future communication systems. As my research evolved, I began exploring new frameworks such as generative models, graphical models, and information theory tools to deepen my understanding and analysis of these complex topics.
