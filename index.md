## About Me

I am a third-year Ph.D. student at School of Electrical and Data Engineering, University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia, working with Dr. [Hoang Dinh](https://sites.google.com/view/dinh-thai-hoang/) and Dr. [Diep Nguyen](https://sites.google.com/view/diep-n-nguyen/). Before joining UTS, I was a research assistant at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, working with Prof. [Dusit Niyato](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/dniyato/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in 2018 from Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam, under supervison of Dr. Nguyen Huu Thanh. 

## Research Interests

During my time at NTU Singapore, I spent most of my time exploring deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve optimization and sequential decision-making problems in communication systems. The problems include blockchain networks, integrated sensing-communications, rate splitting multiple access, and edge computing. During my PhD studies at UTS, I became interested in advanced topics related to virtual reality, brain-computer interfaces, 3D body motion tracking, and their potential applications in future communication systems. As my research interests expanded, I began to explore new frameworks such as generative models, graphical models, and information theory tools to better understand and analyze these topics.
